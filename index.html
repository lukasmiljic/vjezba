	<p><b>It's Peppa Pig</b></p>

	<p>
		As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death<br>
		I take a look at my life and realize there's not much left<br>
		'Coz I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that<br>
		Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone<br>
		But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it<br>
		Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of<br>
		You better watch how you're talkin', and where you're walkin'<br>
		Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk<br>
		I really hate to trip but I gotta, loc<br>
		As I grow I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool<br>
		I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like<br>
		On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight<br><br>
		Been spendin' most their lives,<br>
		Livin' in the gangsta's paradise<br>
		Been spendin' most their lives,<br>
		Livin' in the gangsta's paradise<br>
		Keep spendin' most our lives,<br>
		Livin' in the gangsta's paradise<br>
		Keep spendin' most our lives,<br>
		Livin' in the gangsta's paradise<br>
